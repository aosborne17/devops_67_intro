#Development and Operations

## What is DevOps
- DevOps is the bridge between the operations team and the development team
- Not only is DevOps a job role but it's a culture
- It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
- Tools associated with DevOps include Jenkins, Kubernates, 
## Why DevOps
-  Removes silos (communication barrier between teams)
- Working in small teams allows for shared responsibility and team ethos
- Establishment of automated services means that ongoing operational costs
  are greatly reduced

## Challenges of DevOps
- Overcoming the development vs Operations
- It takes time for a whole organisation to transition into a DevOps culture
 time 
 
## Benefits of DevOps
- Improved Collaboration
- More Secure environment
- Increased delivery


If a problem occurs during the monitoring stage of the cycle, the software can then
be moved straight into the planning phase of development efficiently

Before DevOps each team had to rely on one another before bringing the two together

DevOps has microservices architecture, testing can happen within their own seperate teams.

### Application Design Patterns
Monolith VS N-tier vs Microservice

### Four Pillars of DevOps

- Ease of use
- Flexibility
- Robustness
- Cost Effective

## Automation
Pushing to github would trigger a build, a build would trigger a test and then a software
would run

## DevOps Principles
Customer-Centric Action
End-to-End Responsibility
Automate everything
Continuous Improvement
Work as one team
Monitor and test everything

## Stages in DevOps Lifecycle
Continuous Development
Continuous Testing
Continuous Integration
Continuous Deployment
Continuous Monitoring

## Risk Registers

- Loss of Revenue (If a customer wants to buy something and the server goes down, this is a problem)

### Infrastructure As Code 
Writing Code that will then deploy our software
