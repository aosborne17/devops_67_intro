# Development and Operations

### 1. What is DevOps? 
- DevOps is a set of practices that combines the operations team and the development team.
It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with
high software quality.

Five Main Stages in DevOps:
- Continuous Development (git)
- Continuous Testing (Jenkins)
- Continuous Integration (Jenkins)
- Continuous Deployment (Ansible, CHEF, puppit)
- Continuous Monitoring (Nagios, Splunk)



### 2. Why DevOps?
- Before DevOps each team had to rely on one another before merging the two together
and if there was a problem each team would often blame one another.

- This would often lead to failure of large scale projects being delivered to the client
in a timely manner, which is a huge problem.

- The DevOps culture is about small teams working together, creating a shared responsiblity
and team ethos amongst everyone



### 3. Challenges of DevOps
- It takes time for a whole organisation to transition into a DevOps culture. Dealing with
legacy systems and rebuilding applications to fit microservices architecture and adopting cloud
computing takes a lot of time.

- In addition to this, to be able to fit the DevOps model, teams may need to be rebuild and job positions
may need to be changed and new members hired.

- These challenges lend itself to the reason that many organisations all implement DevOps culture in a slightly
different way

- Overcoming the development vs Operations is also another hurdle that may have to be overcome
 
### 4. Benefits of DevOps
- The benefits of working within a DevOps culture are endless. The improved collaboration mentioned early
reduces inefficiencies and saves time. DevOps also ensures the quality of software updates and infrastructure changes
so they can be delivered more reliability and at a more rapid rate.

- The establishment of automated services means that ongoing operation costs are greatly reduced when working with DevOps.
 THis coupled with the reduced inefficiencies between the Devs and Ops results in a great reduction of cost.

- One of the most important benefits of DevOps is risk mitigation, the continuous monitoring of code means that problems
can be caught quickly and worked on. This reduces any chance of server problems and thus increasing customer satisfaction.
